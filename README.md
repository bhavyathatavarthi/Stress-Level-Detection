# 🧠 Stress Level Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts a person's stress level based on physiological and lifestyle features using a trained machine learning model. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for EDA and training, and a deployed Streamlit web app for interactive predictions.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a system that classifies stress levels using features such as age, heart rate, sleep quality, occupation, and other health indicators.

## 📊 Results

| Metric       | Value      |
|--------------|------------|
| Accuracy     | 98.6%      |
| Precision    | 98.0%      |
| Recall       | 98.0%      |
| F1-Score     | 98.0%      |

✅ The model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing different stress levels (from 3 to 8) based on the input features.
